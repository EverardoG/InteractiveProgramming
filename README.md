# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2018 at Olin College.

To run our game, you'll need to make sure you have python installed on your system, as well as a few libraries for running the game. Here are the commands you'll have to run to import everything you need to so that you can play the game.
sudo apt-get install python-pip  
sudo pip install numpy scipy
sudo apt-get install python-pygame

Then just navigate to the folder the game is in and run
python game.py
